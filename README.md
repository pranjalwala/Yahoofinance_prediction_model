# Yahoo Finance Candlestick Prediction Model 

This repository contains a deep learning–based stock market prediction project built using **Yahoo Finance historical price data**.  
The project focuses on **candlestick-based feature engineering** and trains a **CNN–LSTM neural network** to predict short-term stock price movement.

This is an end-to-end machine learning workflow covering data collection, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.



##  Project Objective

The objective of this project is to:

- Collect historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance
- Extract meaningful candlestick-based numerical features from OHLC data
- Model temporal price patterns using a **CNN–LSTM architecture**
- Predict the direction of future stock price movement
- Evaluate prediction performance using classification metrics
